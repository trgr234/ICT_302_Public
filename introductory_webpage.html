        <h2>Hey Everyone!</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor Griggs and I am a senior ICT major at the <strong>University of Kentucky</strong>. I got into the field of ICT because my sister was an ICT major as well and thought it sounded like something I would enjoy, based off of how much she enjoyed it.</p> 
        <p>I have two animals, a dog named Cookie and a cat named Polar Bear. Here are some pictures of them, in case you were wondering how cute they are:</p>
