        <h2>Hey Everyone!</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor Griggs and I am a senior ICT major at the <strong>University of Kentucky</strong>.</p>
        <p>I love to read, watch horror movies, and go on walks with my dog.</p> 
        <p>I have two animals, a dog, Cookie, and a cat, Polar Bear. Here are some pictures of them, in case you were wondering how cute they are:</p>
